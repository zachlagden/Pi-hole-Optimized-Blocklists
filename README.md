## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About

This repository contains regularly updated, optimized blocklists for use with [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/), the popular DNS-level ad blocker. These lists have been processed with the [Pi-hole Blocklist Optimizer](https://github.com/zachlagden/Pi-hole-Blocklist-Optimizer) to:

- Remove duplicates across all source lists
- Validate all domains for proper formatting
- Organize domains by category
- Pre-optimize for Pi-hole compatibility
- Remove false positives and problematic domains

These lists are updated on a regular basis to ensure they contain the latest threats while minimizing false positives.

- **Standard Protection**: Use the `advertising.txt` and `tracking.txt` lists
- **Enhanced Protection**: Add the `malicious.txt` list
- **Complete Protection**: Use `all_domains.txt` (may require more powerful hardware)
- **Parental Controls**: Add the `nsfw.txt` list

## üìä Statistics

These lists are compiled from over 45 trusted sources, and the current version includes:

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

### Whitelist Recommendations

Some domains may need to be whitelisted to prevent interference with normal services. Common whitelist recommendations:

```
# Microsoft services
outlook.office365.com
products.office.com
c.s-microsoft.com
i.s-microsoft.com

# Google services
accounts.google.com
clients2.google.com
clients4.google.com

# Apple services
appleid.apple.com
token.safebrowsing.apple

# Other services
gravatar.com
s.shopify.com
api.github.com
```

Add these to your Pi-hole whitelist if you experience issues.

### Performance Impact

- Pi-hole can easily handle millions of domains on modern hardware (RPi 4+)
- For older devices (RPi 3 or earlier), consider using only specific category lists instead of all_domains.txt
- The impact on DNS query performance is minimal after initial loading

### How do these compare to default Pi-hole lists?

These lists are considerably more comprehensive than the default Pi-hole lists, offering broader protection across multiple categories.

### Can I use these with AdGuard Home or similar tools?

Yes, these lists use the standard hosts format (`0.0.0.0 domain.com`) which is compatible with most DNS-based blocking tools.

### Do I need all these lists?

No, you can choose which categories to use based on your needs. For most users, the comprehensive list provides excellent protection without requiring multiple lists.
